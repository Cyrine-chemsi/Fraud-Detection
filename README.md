## Fraud Detection Use Case


Below are some json profiles representing fictional customers from an ecommerce company. The profiles contain information about the customer, their orders, their transactions, what payment methods they used and whether the customer is fraudulent or not. The task is to:

 * Transform the json profiles into a dataframe of feature vectors.
 * Provide exploratory analysis of the dataset, and to summarise and explain the key trends in the data, explaining which factors appear to be most important in predicting fraud.
 * Construct a model to predict if a customer is fraudulent based on their profile.
 * Report on the models success and show what features are most important in that model.
